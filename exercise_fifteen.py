# Exercise 15: Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.
# Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.

# given
base1 = 2
exponent1 = 5

base2 = 5
exponent2 = 4

# funtions

def exponent (base, exp):
    if exp > 0:
        print (f"{base} raise to the power of {exp}: {base**exp}\n")
